### 1. **Filter Lifecycle**
   - **Initialization and Destruction**: Understand the lifecycle of a filter, specifically how the `init()` and `destroy()` methods work in `javax.servlet.Filter`. The `init()` method is called once when the filter is first created, and `destroy()` is called when the filter is destroyed, making it a good place for resource cleanup.
   - **Order of Execution**: Explore how filters are executed based on their order in `web.xml` or their `@WebFilter` annotation properties. Learn how filter order affects behavior in a chain of filters.

### 2. **Advanced Filter Chaining**
   - **Filter Execution Order**: If multiple filters are defined, they are invoked in the order defined in `web.xml` or the filter class itself. Understand the difference between `doFilter()` and the continuation mechanism in a chain of filters.
   - **Filter Priority and Dependency**: Learn about the mechanisms to specify priorities when chaining filters. Understand how to manage dependencies between filters and avoid conflicts when multiple filters are interacting with request/response objects.

### 3. **Filter Configuration and Deployment**
   - **Filter Mapping**: Learn how to map filters to specific URLs or patterns, and how to handle specific request types (e.g., only applying a filter to `POST` requests).
   - **Context Parameters**: Some filters may require configuration parameters passed through the `web.xml` or `@WebFilter` annotations. You can also learn how to manage these parameters to make filters configurable based on environment or other variables.

### 4. **Asynchronous Processing in Filters**
   - **Asynchronous Request Handling**: Filters can be involved in managing asynchronous request processing. Explore how `asyncSupported=true` in a filter allows filters to work asynchronously, for example, when integrating with long-running operations.
   - **Async Context**: Learn how filters can interact with the `AsyncContext` to manage long-running asynchronous requests and responses.

### 5. **Security Filters**
   - **Authentication and Authorization Filters**: Dive deeper into security-related filters, such as custom authentication and authorization filters. Understand how to check for valid user sessions, roles, and privileges before the request proceeds.
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: Understand how to implement CSRF protection using filters by inspecting request headers or adding additional security measures like token verification.

### 6. **Custom Response Wrappers in Filters**
   - **Response Modification**: Learn how to use filters to modify the response body or headers. This might include tasks like transforming the output, compressing data, or adding custom headers.
   - **Custom `HttpServletResponseWrapper`**: Explore how to extend `HttpServletResponseWrapper` to create a custom response object that can capture or modify response content, status codes, or headers during the filter process.

### 7. **Performance Considerations**
   - **Optimizing Filter Performance**: Filters can add overhead to each request. Learn how to ensure efficient use of filters to minimize performance degradation. This could involve conditionally applying filters based on specific URL patterns or request parameters.
   - **Cache Control and Response Filtering**: Implement caching strategies using filters, which may involve setting caching headers or managing cache validation during filter processing.

### 8. **Exception Handling and Error Pages in Filters**
   - **Exception Handling in Filters**: Understand how to handle exceptions in filters and propagate errors effectively. Explore how to use filters for centralized exception handling and logging.
   - **Custom Error Pages**: Learn how to use filters to implement custom error handling mechanisms (e.g., custom 404 or 500 pages) or catch and log specific errors before showing the user-friendly response.

### 9. **Integration with CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)**
   - **Dependency Injection in Filters**: Filters can be integrated with CDI to inject dependencies, which is useful when you need access to other services like logging, data access, or configuration. 
   - **Filter Injection Context**: Explore how to use CDI lifecycle in filters (e.g., injecting beans, using scopes like `@RequestScoped`, or controlling dependency lifecycles).

### 10. **Testing Filters**
   - **Unit Testing Filters**: Learn how to effectively write unit tests for filters. This may involve using mocking frameworks such as Mockito to simulate `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, and `FilterChain`.
   - **Integration Testing Filters**: Learn how to write integration tests that involve filters, making sure that the filters behave as expected under different scenarios and configurations.

### 11. **Alternative Filtering Mechanisms (e.g., Interceptors)**
   - **Interceptors vs Filters**: Understand the difference between filters and interceptors in Jakarta EE. While filters are focused on the request/response lifecycle at the servlet level, interceptors are part of the EJB/CDI lifecycle and can be applied to beans, methods, and events.
   - **Global Interceptors**: Learn how to combine the use of filters and interceptors to handle cross-cutting concerns at different layers of the application (e.g., combining logging, security, and transaction management).

### 12. **Best Practices for Filter Usage**
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that filters are used for tasks that are genuinely related to cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and request modification. Avoid putting business logic in filters.
   - **Managing Filter Complexity**: Filters can become complex if you handle too many concerns in a single filter. Learn to break filters into smaller, more manageable units or classes that each handle a single concern.
